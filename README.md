## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The hardest challenge for me was setting up my environment and familiarizing myself with Github and Github Desktop.
As you can see I just have one single giant commit for my final submission, for the future I will try to be more consistent
with staging commits and then do the push at the end when I'm ready to upload so there isn't just one single huge commit.
Basically other than that, just managing my time and setting my expectations for assignments moving forward.
I also definitely need to get better at Javascript as I was learning some of these concepts for the first time,
so I imagine I was a lot slower than my classmates when it comes to finishing this. But yes, my head is in the game.
